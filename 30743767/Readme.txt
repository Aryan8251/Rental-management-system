Project Description - 

"Welcome to the Rental System! This project is designed to streamline and manage various aspects of rental properties efficiently. Our system is divided into three main services to cater to different needs:

Property Management: This feature allows users to manage property listings effectively. Users can add new properties, update existing details, and keep track of property information like addresses, types, and rental amounts.

Tenant Management: This module is dedicated to handling tenant-related tasks. It enables users to add new tenants, update their information, and maintain a record of their contact details, ensuring effective communication and management.

Rental Agreement Management: This section focuses on managing rental agreements. Users can create and track rental agreements, including details such as start and end dates, rent and deposit amounts, and the status of each agreement. The system also ensures that agreements are linked to the appropriate property and tenant through foreign key relationships.

This comprehensive system ensures that all aspects of property management are covered, from maintaining property details and tenant records to managing rental agreements seamlessly. Thank you for your attention, and we hope you find this system both useful and user-friendly!"
